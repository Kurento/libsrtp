Subject: Always allow receiving repeated packets (rx replay)

Force allowing replayed RTP packets at reception (which is forbidden by
libsrtp but we need it). We need to force it always, because the srtpdec
element in gst-plugins-bad doesn't provide any API to change the
'allow_repeat_tx' flag in libsrtp.

With this change, KMS will be able to receive packets that had been
already received (replay on reception, checked at srtp_unprotect()),
which adds up to the already existing capability of re-sending RTP
packets that had been already sent (replay on transmission, checked at
srtp_protect(), which is the original intent of 'allow_repeat_tx' in
libsrtp). This feature had been asked for in the libsrtp bugtracker but
the authors rejected it for security reasons:
https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp/pull/37
https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp/pull/63

This change is in spirit a summary of old changes for Kurento that were
done at:
https://github.com/Kurento/libsrtp/commit/b27df0c85f0553e7a04fc4acd699c634061c931c
https://github.com/Kurento/libsrtp/commit/c6972859b539099193deb91e8c002c8a13cf58ea
https://github.com/Kurento/libsrtp/commit/55bec21f7cb50cc940d341dd28ebb8a97a79ee5e

However, the old code had two problems:
- It ignored not only replay errors, but *all* of them (!!)
- It didn't actually work! because setting 'allow_repeat_tx = true' is
only done by GStreamer's srtpenc but not srtpdec, which means that
reception replays were still rejected by libsrtp, even when these
changes were applied.
